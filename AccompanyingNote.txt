HELPFUL NOTES

My BankAccount class has nearly 2000 lines of code so trying to 'decode' it at 'first pass' will be a very challenging and arduous task. So, why not 'try it before decoding it'.

Simply download the file and open on your favourite IPython console and execute. It is a fully non-GUI easy-to-run interactive experience throughout.

The class (as currently written) can:
Run current and business accounts indefinitely.
Run savings account at a fixed interest rate indefinitely if no withdrawals/additions are made.
Run savings account if a withdrawal or addition is made by adding a one-off interest that keeps the balance unchanged until a new withdrawal or addition is made.
Do transfers between current, savings, and business accounts.
Identify valid ATM card numbers.
Assess pin numbers and their correctness for the ATM card number entered (gives you the choice of pin the first time the card number is entered then 'locks' the two).
Give a dated history of all transactions in all accounts ('Paid in', 'Paid out', 'Transferred', 'Total interest', 'Total expense fees').
Only work in pounds sterling (Â£).
Create and update files it generates.

The class (as currently written) cannot:
Do the above for different named people (set for 'Some Body' although I am considering a more generic version of the class).
Create folders (again, this is intended for the more generic version).
